        <p>need something here to fill the rest of the page, idk what yet, it could just be information about each of the subjects/what the student projects are for each one, may want to have a student projects page completely seperate from the subjects where all student projects would be displayed for each subject, it would basically mean moving this page to a student project only centered page and having a completely new page centered only around the subjects. so say I still have the hoverable buttons with drop downs, but instead of showing student projects it show information about that course. That solution would however mean that I would need another page on the top bar for student projects which may further clutter the bar when the page is squeezed (already an issue). I jest feel that moving all student projects to a specific page would make things clearer, it would allow people to go to the subject page and learn about stuff and get news about what mey be happening in the class and then go to the student projects, or use the navbar to go strait to student projects, find the project they did, and look for theirs</p>
